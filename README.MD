These are show case sample programs to get a basic understanding of various different technologies, each application will be built upon the same following concepts:

- Authentication: There should be protect, and unprotected routes which are only accessible to certain users
- CRUD: The should be basic CRUD elements implemented
- Persistant Storage: Some method of persistant storage should be use.

## Project

A basic TODO Application will be used as the core concept, it will provide a login, and logout function allowing the users to CRUD their own todos, and they should
not be able to access the todos of other users.
